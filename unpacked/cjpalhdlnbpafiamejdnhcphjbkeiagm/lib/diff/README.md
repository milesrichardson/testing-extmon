This uses the [_An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and Its Variations_](http://www.xmailserver.org/diff2.pdf) Also see

## Installation

    $ npm install diff
    $ component install Swatinem/diff

## Usage

### diff(a, b, [eql(a, b)])

Given two arrays (or array-likes, such as strings) `a` and `b` and an optional equal function `eql`, this will return an array with the
following operations:

- _nop_ the element is in both arrays
- _ins_ the element is only in array `b` and will be inserted
- _del_ the element in only in array `a` and will be removed
- _rep_ the element from `a` will be replaced by the element from `b`. This is essentially the same as a del+ins
